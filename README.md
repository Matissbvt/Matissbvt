### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Matiss**](https://guns.lol/matissbvt), a back-end developper based in Lyon.

I code and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is C, bash, javascript, and java. My favorite tools are apple notes, and things on my iPhone.

#### Fun Facts:

* I have the better dad in this world
* I don’t like kombucha
* Suits is my favorite series
* **Hobbies:** code, cars and sportscars
